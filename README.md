"A Swin Transformer based Framework for Shape Recognition." 2022 14th International Conference on Machine Learning and Computing (ICMLC). 2022. https://doi.org/10.1145/3529836.3529894

(1) We propose a neural network model based on the Swin Transformer to classify 2D shapes.  
(2) An all-scale representation of shape features is designed as a preprocessing method to assist 2D shape recognition. 

Our code use the Animal and MPEG-7 datasets as input to test performance, which obtains an accuracy of 93.82% and 98.02%, respectively.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model has a superior performance on shape recognition tasks.
